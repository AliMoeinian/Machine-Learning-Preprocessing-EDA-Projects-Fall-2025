# Machine Learning Preprocessing & EDA - Isfahan University

This repository contains materials I designed and delivered as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) section of the Machine Learning course at Isfahan University, taught by Dr. Reza Ramezani(Fall 2025). As part of a TA team, I handled this foundational module, including a workshop, one project, and one practical exam, emphasizing data cleaning, analysis, and real-world insights using Python tools like Pandas and visualization libraries.

## Materials Overview

### Workshop: Introduction to Preprocessing and EDA
A hands-on session covering the importance of data-first approaches in ML, including lessons from industry experts on prioritizing data quality over models, choosing metrics, starting with baselines, and conducting thorough EDA. Practical guidance on understanding datasets, handling missing values, and analyzing real vs. clean data differences, with examples from LinkedIn posts and Kaggle datasets.

### Project 1: Preprocessing and EDA
Focuses on descriptive questions about the ML lifecycle for a movie recommendation system, comparing clean vs. real-world datasets (with Kaggle examples), and practical EDA tasks emphasizing deep analysis over mere visualizations. Students explore data understanding, cleaning strategies, and insights from a provided dataset, stressing the role of EDA in guiding ML projects.

### Practical Exam 1: Data Analysis on Sales Dataset
A timed, supervised exam simulating a Lead Data Analyst role at an e-commerce company, involving dataset exploration (columns, formats, missing values), data cleaning, feature engineering (e.g., date modifications), and EDA tasks like sales trends, top products, buying patterns by day/gender/country, and revenue shares via charts. Culminates in a one-line report for marketing decisions, allowing AI tools but requiring original analysis.

## Usage
- These resources can serve as teaching aids, student assignments, or self-study for ML beginners focusing on data preparation.
- Note: The exam includes monitoring instructions via a custom app to ensure integrity.
